My family and I grow and carve hundreds of pumpkins every year and we needed a place to show them off. Plus this was a great opportunity to become more familiar with Contentful. [Check it out!](https://www.utahpumpkins.com)


## Features
This was my first real Contentful site and I had a ton of fun using Gatsby and Contentful together. Shoutout to this [CodingTheSmartWay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY3mBJSDA44) for the quick setup tutorial. It was a pretty straightforward integration. Parsing the rich text provided by Contentful was super easy using their [rich-text-react-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@contentful/rich-text-react-renderer) plugin. 

This is a gallery created using Gatsby so of course [Gatsby Image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) was heavily utilitized for image optimization. In particular I liked the [Traced SVG](https://using-gatsby-image.gatsbyjs.org/traced-svg/) feature.

I'm also using this site to become more familiar with SEO principals and using the Google tools such as [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) and [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/).
